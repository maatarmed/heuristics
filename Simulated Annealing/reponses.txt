Exercice1:
1) When the temperature is high (T=10^6) we have alo of randomness in our energy during the whole process (the energy varies all the time becuase the probability to go to the next city is always almost 1 even if the solution doesn't improve the best solution)=> encourages exploration

2) When T is near 0 we almost have no randomness in choosing next city, we take only values that improve our best solution (exploitation)

3) 


Exercice2:
1) number of improvements: ti7at uniq : graph 2. ImprovementRation =number of improvements/number of evaluations(iterations)

2)performance critera is after how much iterations do we get an good result

3) stable if we run multipule times it we get always good solution (near optimal)(all have almost same solution)
